I've butchered @dory111111 (https://github.com/dory111111/babyagi-streamlit) 's babyagi-streamlit app to make it suit the Streamlit state model and page refresh to capture user input so it's lost it's object encapsulation but for learning it works okay. Thanks dory111111!

# Demo
Coming soon!


# Installation

Install the required packages:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

# Usage

Run streamlit.
````
streamlit run babyinterviewagi.py 
````

You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501

To stop the Streamlit server, press ctrl-C.

# Acknowledgments

This is my first streamlit and OpenAI app for which is based off @dory111111 (https://github.com/dory111111/babyagi-streamlit) 's fork of the original BabyAGI by @yoheinakajima (https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)

I've changed it to make it suite Streamlit state model and page refresh for user input so it's lost it's object encapsulation but for learning it works okay. Thanks dory111111!
